## 二、其余具有参考意义的论文中所使用的评估方法：

暂无

# 角度二：”自定义指标“以证明模型强度

## 一、具有参考意义的论文中使用的自定义指标：

### 1、使用“收入提升”来说明模型的强度

#### 论文一：The Rich and the Poor: A Markov Decision Process Approach to Optimizing Taxi Driver Revenue Efficiency

来源：CIKM ’16

##### 问题一：如何定义“高收入”“低收入”？

> Revenue Efficiency. An obvious way to increase revenue is by driving taxi for longer time duration. However, given time constraints, it makes sense to maximize revenue per unit of time.
>

>
>  About 80% drivers have a revenue efficiency between 0.72 and 0.80. We find the top 10% and bottom 10% drivers as successful and not-so-successful drivers.

##### 问题二：针对高低收入如何评估和比较：

![image-20210125205344906](C:%5CUsers%5Clenovo%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5Cimage-20210125205344906.png)

### 2、使用“载客率提升”来说明模型的强度

#### 论文二：Route Recommendations for Idle Taxi Drivers: Find Me the Shortest Route to a Customer!

来源：kdd18

##### 问题一：如何选择random/top数据集并评估

对比random/top两数据集在不同情况下的improvement%，在我的情况下，这个提升率可以换成两种不同收入群体的收入提升率，比如低收入群体/高收入群体原本的pick-up numbers对比应用模型后的pick-up numbers.

> The training set is constructed using two strategies. <u>In the first strategy, we **randomly select X%** of all taxi drivers.</u> All customer pick-ups serviced by these selected taxi drivers and their corresponding driving routes form the training set. X guides the size of the training set. We call this the Random training set. The second strategy is inspired by [13]. Here, each taxi driver is sorted based on the number of customer pick-ups they have on record. <u>The top-X drivers with the **highest customer pick-ups** are selected and their customer pick-ups and driving routes form the training set.</u>

##### 问题二：如何对密集/稀疏区域适应（Case Study）

可以作为一个Case Study，用两块人流密集/人流稀疏的区域做对比：

> Impact of customer density: The experiment against number of recommendations indicated that when customer density is low, performance improvement of MDM is more profound. We next verify the impact of customer density directly.
>
> We further substantiate the ability of MDM to do well in difficult situations by computing the improvement in customer-sparse neighborhoods. In these experiments, we choose the query regions from only sparse neighborhoods of various intensities. For example, Sparse-10% contains only top-10% sparsest neighborhoods.

>
> In the x axis we plot the number of query recommendations per segment, instead of total number of recommendations since the number of segments in a region varies. For example, the number of segments in Sparse-10% is much smaller than in Sparse-50%. As clearly visible, the sparser the region, the higher is the improvement provided by MDM. 

##### 问题三：对异常的敏感性，特殊拥堵（Case Study）

虽然目前没有对拥堵的解决办法，但可以添加一个功能：

在推荐时，每当一个地点出现在推荐累计x次之后，在t分钟内该地点不会再次出现在推荐列表中，也算是动态避免拥堵。

> ![image-20210125212308325](C:%5CUsers%5Clenovo%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5Cimage-20210125212308325.png)

##### 问题四：对时间片的敏感性：

> Adapting to time-slots: How does the performance of MDM vary against various times of the day? We next answer this question. First, we partition the dataset into four different timeslots: 1. 12AM −8AM, 2. 8AM −12PM, 3. 12PM −5PM, 4. 5PM −11:59PM. Generally slot 1 and 3 are non-peak hours, whereas 2 and 4 are peak hours. As shown in Fig. 5(i), regardless of the time of the day, MDM has a performance improvement in the range of 35% to 65%.

#### 论文三：A Cost-Effective Recommender System for Taxi Drivers

来源：kdd14

##### Case Study 1：A Case Study on Cost-Effective Route Recommendations

作者用自己模型的两条推荐路径和谷歌地图的推荐路径对比，说明：

自己的推荐路径长度虽然和谷歌地图的推荐路线不一样，但是计算出租车所得收入却高出不少

> ![image-20210125213048020](C:%5CUsers%5Clenovo%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5Cimage-20210125213048020.png)
>
> the left figures are the driving route recommended by the MNP recommender system and the right figures are the route suggested by the Google Map based on the shortest driving distance. However, this driving route suggested by the Google map cannot maximize taxi drivers’ net profit.

##### Case Study 2：A Case Study on Top-K Recommendations

这个Case Study，作者想说明，自己的Top-K推荐可以明显地通过减少冗余来提升模型性能

>  we introduced a minimum redundant strategy to recommend the Top-K driving routes and solved the overloaded problem. In figure 11, we demonstrate the Top K driving routes starting from the same location, where K equals to 4 in this case. The figure shows that each route has different driving directions and the correlations between those driving distances are very small. Therefore, the minimum redundant strategy can improve the performance of our recommender system.
